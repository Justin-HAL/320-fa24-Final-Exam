Multithreaded Pac-Man Game:

ðŸ•¹ Overview:

This project implements a multithreaded version of the classic Pac-Man game using Python. Each game agent (player and ghosts) operates as an independent thread, ensuring smooth and concurrent gameplay. The game features shared memory synchronization, collision avoidance, and a real-time display powered by Pygame.

âœ¨ Features:

Core Mechanics:

Player-controlled Pac-Man collects dots and energizers.
Ghosts with unique AI behaviors (chase, random).
Power-ups allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts temporarily.

ðŸ“‹ Requirements:

Python 3.8+
Pygame library (pip install pygame)

ðŸš€ How to Run:

Clone the repository:

1. git clone https://github.com/Justin-HAL/320-fa24-Final-Exam
cd 320-fa24-Final-Exam
